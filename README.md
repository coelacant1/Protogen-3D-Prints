# Coela Can't! Protogen 3D Files

This repository merges several different 3D-printable **Protogen head** projects into one place for easier access. Each subfolder contains split `.stl` files and related documentation for printing. Below is a quick overview of the included protogen variants:

- **BetaProtogen**  
- **DeltaProtogen**  
- **EpsilonProtogen**  
- **GammProtogen**  
- **SigmaProtogen**

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a variant (e.g. `BetaProtogen`, `DeltaProtogen`, etc.). Inside, youâ€™ll find folders with `.stl` files split into parts suitable for most 3D printers.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.  
2. Navigate to the folder of the Protogen variant you wish to print.  
3. Import the `.stl` files into your 3D slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).  
4. Adjust your printer settings (infill, supports, layer height, etc.).  
5. Slice and start printing!

## Printing Tips

- **Supports**: Many of these designs need supports in areas like ear bases or chin details.  
- **Layer Height**: A layer height of 0.2mm or finer is recommended for smooth curves.
- **Infill**: 10-15% is often enough, but consider 25%+ for more durability.
- **Material**: All designs are made to be printed with PETG, except for the Sigma, which is designed for TPU filament.
